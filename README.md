# Pyguin
Nobody asked for it but it's getting made anyway, another static site generator written in Python.
# Installation instructions

It's available on PyPi, so you should be able to simply ```pip install pyguin``` and evoke ```pyguin``` in your terminal.
# Documentation
There are semi-useful help messages in the CLI tool as it is now, stand by for better documentation.
